      <h2 id="topic1"> What is LoL Churn Predictor? </h2>

        <p> New League of Legends players begin as a level 1 "summoner".
          They must play enough matches against computers to become a level 3 summoner (roughly 3-4 matches) before they can play against other humans.
          League of Legends matches are often 15-30 minutes each, making the investment to become a level 3 summoner significant for a new player.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Given gameplay data from the first match of a new League of Legends player, this project seeks to
            predict whether that player will get to level 3 within one month of their first match.</b>
        </p>

      <h2 id="topic2"> Background motivation </h2>

        <p> Churn rate is often defined as the number of customers/players/users that have stopped using a product/service for a specific period of time (perhaps a month).
          Generally, churn rate considers the entire customer base (not just new or old customers). However, for a product like a video game, the first few moments have a profound
          can cause someone to never play the game again or it can plant the seed of a superfan that has great loyalty and interest in everything about the game.
          <br>
          <br>
          There are some acceptable reasons why a customer would leave a product/service, perhaps the customer has happily fulfilled their needs with the product and it was a natural time
          for them to stop using the product. However, many other reasons might be avoidable, for example, in a game like League of Legends, a player may stop playing the game due to frustration
          with non-intuitive controls or game mechanics. Maybe even just a small encouragement could completely change that player's outlook on those first few experiences with the game.
          <br>
          <br>
          With that in mind, this churn predictor project seeks to identify these players that may give up on the game before giving it a proper chance to impress them.
        </p>


      <h2 id="topic3"> Data Collection </h2>

        <p> This project gathers data from Riot's API <sup><a href="#resource_1">[1]</a></sup>
          using the Cassiopeia <sup><a href="#resource_2">[2]</a></sup> python library.
          <br>
          <br>
          The API gives access to basic data about a player as well as their match history
          and in-game data from each match. Note, the API spans three years from the current date,
          so any data older than three years is not accessible.
        </p>
          <br>
          <br>

        <p> Here is an example of some basic information you can get from a player: </p>

          <table>
            <tr>
              <th>Summoner name</th>
              <th>Summoner id</th>
              <th>Summoner level</th>
              <th>Region (server)</th>
              <th>Number of matches<br>(in last three years)</th>
              <th></th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Msendak</td>
              <td>37709821</td>
              <td>52</td>
              <td>North America</td>
              <td>2806</td>
            </tr>
          </table>

        <p> And here is some data from this player's most recent match: </p>

          <!-- <table>
            <tr>
              <th></th>
              <th></th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td></td>
              <td></td>
            </tr>
          </table> -->


      <h2 id="topic4"> Exploratory Data Analysis </h2>

        <p>

        </p>

        <p> All players in the dataset are within levels one to five:</p>
          <img src="summoner_level_high_res.png">

        <p> Notice how the distribution is skewed toward players that are levels four and five.
          This is another artifact of the way data was collected and does not necessarily mean
          that more LoL players are levels four and five than one through three.
        </p>
