# League of Legends Churn Prediction

New League of Legends players start as level 1 "summoners" and can only play matches against computers. Once a player becomes a level 3 summoner (about 3-4 matches) they can play against other humans (the real meat of the game).

### Project goal: 

Based on the performance of a player's first match, is that player going to make it to level 3 or give up on the game before then?
