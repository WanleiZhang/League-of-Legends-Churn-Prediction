# League of Legends Churn Prediction

Three part project to model prediction of "churn" (not exactly churn) in new players of Riot's League of Legends game. 

More specifically: based on the performance of a player's first match, is that player going to make it to level 3.

This project uses <a href="https://developer.riotgames.com/">Riot's API</a> as data source and the <a href="http://cassiopeia.readthedocs.io">Cassiopeia</a> library to access that API.
